* CHANGELOG
** Revision 1
   Thanks to Lexikos for most of these suggestions
   merged with AutoHotkeyV10.48_L26 
   building release version as well as debug version as it is smaller
   changed sbclPointer to argv. 
   also changed some variable names in autohotkey.cpp. 
   any string can now be passed as the second var to ahkdll(name, argv)
** First Rlease
*** dllmain()
    change winmain() to oldwinmain()

    hInstance is stored as a static variable 

    ahkdll can now be embedded within ahk itself

*** Project settings
    changed compile type to dll

*** exported functions
    ahkgetvar(variableName)
    ahkdll(filename, argv) 
** org-mode settings
