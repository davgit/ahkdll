AutoHotkey_N
Introduction

AutoHotkey.dll is a shared library for autohotkey maintained by Naveen Garg.
Features include:

    * Embed the autohotkey interpreter in another program such as python or lisp
      int ahkdll(char *fileName, char *option, char *parameter)
    * dynamically add #include type files to a running script with addfile()
      _declspec(dllexport) int addFile(str file, uchar aAllowDuplicateInclude, uchar aIgnoreLoadFailure)
    * import new scripts or replace loaded script with import(file...)
    * Partial support for multithreading
      by loading multiple copies of the dll under different names
    * Direct access to built in variables BIV

Download: binary, source

Note

    * AutoHotkey.dll is a branch from Lexikos' custom build.
    * I will try to track the main AutoHotkey branch as well: ahkcn
    * My changes and additions to the source code follow the same license as the main AutoHotkey branch: GPLv2

Todo

    * Export built in commands and functions
    * build application / webserver framework, possibly using sparrow
    * Reclaim / reuse memory from ignored lines and functions from repeated use of import().

Version History
Revision 7

    * Merged with AutoHotkey v.1.0.48.03_L30
    * in addition to AutoHotkey.dll, created AutoHotkey_N.exe with
    * exported functions to access built in variables: ebiv.cpp
    * added function:
    * linepointer = Import(filename, aAllowDuplicateInclude = false, aIgnoreLoadFailure = false).
    * linepointer is a pointer to the first line in the imported script
    * If the 3rd parameter is > 1, then all currently loaded lines, functions, and labels are ignored starting now.
    * If you are going to reload particular hotkeys, use the Hotkey command rather than Hotkey labels.
    * i.e.
    * Hotkey, F2, mylabel, on ; this can be repeated in future import(script) calls
    * not
    * F2::msgbox ; this will crash the script if you import another script that uses the same hotkey label
